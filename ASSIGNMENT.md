# Module Documentation

The below questions should be answered (in detail!) regarding your submission.

##### 1. Reflect on how you "learned" to use the library and write the examples, c.f the "Unfamiliar APIs" reading. What is one aspect of the module's code that made is easy to understand? What is one change that would have made it easier?
> I manually compiled the code by writing it down and stepping through each step. It was quite tedious but I was able to understand what the module did a lot better. Also, the underline functionality it utilized was Node's default crypto module. What made it easy to understand was the simplicity of how the author structured it. Basically, the code exposed one public in line function object that returns 4 smaller objects that does everything. In this way, the author condensed the code considerably into a more eye pleasing code.


##### 2. Consider the process of writing comments that "raise the level of abstraction." What does this mean to you? If you had to explain to a new CS142 student how to write an effective comment, what would you say? #####
> Raising the level of abstraction means to talk about the end goal or state of the function or method. If I had the opportunity to explain to a new CSE 142 student on how to write effective comments, than I would provide myriads of examples starting from the most basic to more difficult ones. Also, I would tell them that it shouldn't just be repeating what the code does verbatim but what how or why in a more general term.


##### 3. Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> I spent about 5 hours on the assignment. The most time spent was actually looking for a module to comment on.


##### 4. Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> No


##### 5. Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> The most time consuming process was to actually find a module small enough to comment on.
